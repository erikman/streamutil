# Helper library for working with node streams

This is a collection of stream helpers to bridge the gap between promises and streams. It was
created for some internal projects and may not be of production quality.

You proably want to use a more maintained package like https://www.npmjs.com/package/mississippi
instead :) This was made for my personal understanding of streams and error handling with streams.

See the test suite for examples on usage.
